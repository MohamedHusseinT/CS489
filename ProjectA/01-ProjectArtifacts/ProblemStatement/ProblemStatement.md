# Problem Statement - Advantis Dental Surgeries (ADS)

## Business Context
Advantis Dental Surgeries (ADS) is a growing dental practice that needs a comprehensive digital solution to manage their operations efficiently. Currently, ADS relies on manual processes and disconnected systems to manage patient information, appointments, and administrative tasks, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors.

## Current Challenges
- **Manual Patient Management**: Patient information is stored in paper files and basic spreadsheets, making it difficult to track patient history and appointments
- **Appointment Scheduling Issues**: No centralized system for managing appointments, leading to double bookings and scheduling conflicts
- **Data Inconsistency**: Patient information scattered across multiple systems without proper integration
- **Limited Reporting**: Difficulty in generating reports for business analysis and compliance
- **Security Concerns**: Sensitive patient data stored in unsecured formats
- **Scalability Issues**: Current manual processes cannot support practice growth

## Proposed Solution
Develop a comprehensive web-based dental surgery management system that provides:
- **Centralized Patient Management**: Digital patient records with complete medical history
- **Automated Appointment Scheduling**: Real-time scheduling system with conflict prevention
- **Integrated Address Management**: Unified system for managing patient and surgery locations
- **Secure Data Management**: Role-based access control and data encryption
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Automated reports for business insights and compliance
- **Mobile-Responsive Interface**: Access from any device for maximum flexibility

## Success Criteria
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce appointment scheduling time by 70%
- **Data Accuracy**: Achieve 99% data consistency across all systems
- **User Satisfaction**: Achieve 90% user satisfaction rating from staff
- **Security Compliance**: Meet healthcare data protection standards
- **System Availability**: Maintain 99.9% uptime for critical operations

## Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: 
  - Dental staff (dentists, hygienists, assistants)
  - Administrative staff (receptionists, office managers)
  - Practice managers
- **Secondary Users**: 
  - Patients (through patient portal features)
  - Insurance companies (through reporting)
- **Business Owners**: 
  - Practice owners and partners
  - IT administrators

## Scope
### In Scope
- Patient registration and profile management
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Address management for patients and surgeries
- Dentist profile and specialization tracking
- Surgery room management
- User authentication and authorization
- Basic reporting and analytics
- Mobile-responsive web interface

### Out of Scope
- Payment processing and billing
- Insurance claim management
- Advanced medical imaging
- Third-party integrations (initially)
- Mobile native applications

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Must use .NET 8 and SQLite for development, with potential migration to PostgreSQL for production
- **Budget**: Limited budget for third-party services and external integrations
- **Time**: Must be completed within 10-week development timeline
- **Resources**: Small development team with limited specialized healthcare IT experience

## Assumptions
- Staff will be trained on the new system before deployment
- Internet connectivity will be available at all practice locations
- Existing patient data can be migrated from current systems
- Users are comfortable with web-based applications
- Practice will grow moderately over the next 2-3 years
