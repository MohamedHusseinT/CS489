For this Lab Assignment 6, you are required to create a Spring Boot CLI application project and implement enterprise Data Persistence using Spring Data JPA, for the ADS Dental Surgeries Appointments management system. See the sample Domain model attached.

In your solution, have your Java code generate/create the Database schema correctly based on the given designed domain model (i.e. there should be the following Database Tables: patients, dentists, surgeries, addresses, appointments, users and roles), including the PK/FK relationships as required.

Also, add Java code to populate your database tables with the sample Data, see attached.

For practice, implement code to perform the basic CRUD operations using the data.

Use my example from the CityLibraryApp project from lesson6-jpa.zip, which is attached for you here in zip file), as a guide.

For submission, commit/push your solution to your github and submit the url.

Alternatively, implement Data Persistence for your Project.
